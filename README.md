# DistRDF_benchmarks
Set of benchmarks for DistRDF


## ROOT

The [following ROOT version](https://github.com/vepadulano/root/tree/distrdf-dask-optimized) is used for the benchmarks. It has O1 optimizations, as of the [PR on slide 7](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1084843/contributions/4561167/attachments/2324353/3958709/PPP%20Improving%20the%20performance%20of%20DistRDF%20tasks.pdf) and it is modified to use Dask.
